# Intercellular-Communications-and-Multilayer-GRN-of-EMT

Walkthrough: Mouse skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC dataset): This dataset of 382 cells on skin tumors contains FACS_isolated epithelial YFP+Epcam+ tumor cells, which are relatively homogeneous, and mesenchymal-like YFP+Epcam- tumor cells, which are more heterogeneous.

1) [QuanTC](https://github.com/yutongo/QuanTC/blob/master/Example/QuanTC_SCC.pdf): clustering and transition trajectory reconstruction. 
2) SoptSC: qualitatively characterizing cell-cell communications
3) Multilayer regulations of EMT
